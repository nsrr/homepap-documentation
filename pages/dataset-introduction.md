# Dataset introduction

The [Home Positive Airway Pressure (HomePAP) dataset](:files_path:/datasets) posted on the NSRR has gone through various post-processing steps in order to prepare the data for more widespread sharing. Changes and updates to the source data and variable definitions have been coordinated in the [homepap-data-dictionary repository](https://github.com/sleepepi/homepap-data-dictionary).

**Disclaimer:** These data are not perfect. Please [submit issues](https://github.com/sleepepi/homepap-data-dictionary/issues) or [write on the Forum](https://sleepdata.org/forum) for any problematic findings.

## Structure of the dataset

The HomePAP dataset is broken down into three (3) files that correspond to the main study visit encounters.

1. `baseline` (Baseline) - 373 records, i.e. randomized subjects
2. `month1` (Month 1 follow-up) - 152 subjects with data
3. `month3` (Month 3 follow-up) - 140 subjects with data

The follow-up datasets also contain 373 records, though data will be missing for subjects who did not complete these visits.
