# About

The Home Positive Airway Pressure (HomePAP) study was a multisite, nonblinded, randomized controlled trial that enrolled 373 patients at seven American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM)-accredited academic sleep centers with a high pretest probability of moderate to severe OSA (based on a clinical algorithm). Eligible subjects were evaluated in clinic and randomized to one of two management pathways. Those randomized to the laboratory-based pathway underwent attended overnight PSG in an accredited sleep laboratory, followed by a second attended overnight PSG for titration with CPAP. If the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) was ≥15 during the first 2 h of the initial PSG, the patient proceeded with CPAP titration in the same night, termed a "split-night" study. Those randomized to the home-based pathway were given a portable limited-channel sleep monitoring device (EmblettaX-30, Embla Inc., Broomfield, CO, USA) which was taken home. These patients received standardized in-person training on how to apply the monitoring device on at night by personnel affiliated with each accredited sleep center, and technicians were available overnight by phone to answer any questions. The monitoring device was returned to the sleep center the following morning by the patient or by courier service, depending on center preference. Those in the home-based arm with an AHI ≥15 were then provided an autotitrating CPAP machine (REMStar Auto-M Series; Philips-Respironics, Murraysville, PA, USA) to use at home for 5–7 nights to perform their CPAP titration. All subjects with an AHI ≥ 15 who underwent a successful CPAP titration study were offered CPAP therapy. Subjects were re-evaluated in clinic after 1- and 3-mo follow-up periods.
