# About

The Home Positive Airway Pressure (HomePAP) study was a multisite, nonblinded, randomized controlled trial that enrolled 373 patients at seven American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM)-accredited academic sleep centers with a high pretest probability of moderate to severe OSA (based on a clinical algorithm). Eligible subjects were evaluated in clinic and randomized to one of two management pathways: 1) laboratory-based and 2) home-based. All subjects with an AHI â‰¥ 15 who underwent a successful CPAP titration study were offered CPAP therapy. Subjects were re-evaluated in clinic after 1- and 3-month follow-up periods.
